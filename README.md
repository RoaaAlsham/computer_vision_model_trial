# computer_vision_model_trial

a project made to practice concepts of an introduction lecture of computer vision 

### summary: 

made a trail for [Deep-Fake-Detector-v2-Model](https://huggingface.co/prithivMLmods/Deep-Fake-Detector-v2-Model) on Google Collab with dataset obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dagnelies/deepfake-faces)

example output: 

<img width="1666" height="804" alt="2025-12-12 23_40_29-" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81f83d59-88ef-49f7-8db0-27f6481d89df" />

-> the output is as expected

<img width="1654" height="774" alt="2025-12-13 00_04_03-" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3b7817-1f87-412a-ac36-645334be42d8" />

-> the output had to indicate that it is not normal (fake) image

### result: 
The model needs more training to distinguish real and fake faces better.
